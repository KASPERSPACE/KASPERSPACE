Hello, I'm Kasper (not the friendly ghost), I'm 13, I'm autistic, my birthday is on August 30th, and I go by they/it pronouns! 
as stated before, I'm a artist, I mainly draw humans and anthros (i'm not a furry), though I do try to branch out to other things like robots and stuff. 
I also love to 3d model in blender from time to time, usually these models are for VRChat. I also do website coding liek html and css, im not good with javascript though :,-(

I like adventure time, cookie run, wakfu, roblox (specific games being phighting, regretevator, and a little bit of royale high), 
sparklecare, any scott pilgrim media and a little bit of ranfren (perhaps im a bit of a nerd)

^^ stuff above was mostly taken from my awesome website

I'm also very hyperfixated on gumlee (marshall lee x prince gumball/gary prince) and i love cats

dni list:
queer exclusive (people who dont like lesboys/gaybians/neopronouns/etc) cuz im literally a gaybian myself.
fans of fnf vs eteled system overload.
btd/your boyfriend fans yall are fucking weird
