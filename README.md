<h1>KASPERSPACE ! (mainly ponytown stuff,,)</h1>
Hello, I'm Kasper (not the friendly ghost), I'm 14, I'm autistic, my birthday is on August 30th, and I go by they/he pronouns! </br> as stated before, I'm a artist, I mainly draw humans and anthros (i'm not a furry), though I do try to branch out to other things like robots and stuff. 
</br> 
I also love to 3d model in blender from time to time, usually these models are for VRChat. I also do website coding liek html and css, im not good with javascript though :,-( 
</br></br> 
I like adventure time, cookie run, wakfu, gravity falls, roblox (specific games being phighting, regretevator, and a little bit of royale high), sparklecare, any scott pilgrim media and a little bit of ranfren (perhaps im a bit of a nerd) 


I'm also very hyperfixated on gumlee (marshall lee x prince gumball/gary prince) and i love cats
